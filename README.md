Revised Project Proposal: Movie Rating and Recommendation Platform Prototype

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a prototype version of a Movie Rating and Recommendation Platform. This prototype will focus on testing the fundamental functionalities of the search and rating systems.

Movie Search:

Users can test the movie search functionality by entering keywords, titles, or genres into the search field.
The search results will not connect to a database but will display a mockup of relevant information such as movie details, ratings, and a brief synopsis.
User Ratings and Reviews:

Registered users can participate in testing the movie rating system by rating a set of three predefined films on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
Users can leave brief comments or reviews about their test experience.
Average Rating Calculation:

The prototype will showcase the calculation and display of the average rating for the three predefined films based on user test submissions.
Personalized Recommendations:

As this is a prototype, the personalized recommendation feature will not be implemented or tested in this phase.
User Authentication and Profiles:

Users can create accounts and log in to the platform, but the profile functionality will be limited to the rating of the three predefined films.
Mobile Responsiveness:

The prototype will be designed to be responsive, ensuring a basic user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
